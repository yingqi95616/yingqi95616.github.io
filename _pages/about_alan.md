Howdy! My name is Alan and I earned my bachelor's degree in Civil Engineering from Texas Tech University. I am currently a third-year Environmental Engineering Ph.D. student. My research focuses on modeling future climate and air quality at high spatio-temporal resolutions, with the goal of assessing potential inequalities at a community level. During my free time, I enjoy running and painting. In the future, I hope to become a professor and guide students towards becoming the best version of themselves!
