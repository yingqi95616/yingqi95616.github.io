[Dr. Xue Qiao](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Xue-Qiao) visited Dr. Ying's group as a visiting Ph.D. student from Sichun University in 2014 to study the source contributions to atmospheric deposition fluxes of nitrate, sulfate, and ammonium ions in China. Currently, Dr. Qiao is an associate professor at [Sichuan University](https://inelt.scu.edu.cn/info/1023/1704.htm). She uses both atmospheric monitoring and modeling tools to investigate air pollution in southwestern china, particularly the Sichuan Basin and the eastern rim of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. Her group investigates the status, long-term trends, sources, and future scenarios of sulfur and nitrogen deposition, ozone, particulate matter, and heavy metals. Additionally, her group explores airborne microbes and uses tree and lake cores to reconstruct climate and air pollution histories. Her group has long-term air pollution monitoring in several world natural heritage properties, where she has participated in several ecological conservation and restoration projects. She has written several environmental impact assessment reports, some of which were submitted to the IUCN and UNESCO WHC. Furthermore, she studies tufa/travertine formation and degradation from various perspectives, such as atmospheric CO2 flux, biogeochemistry, acid rain, soil erosion, and others.
