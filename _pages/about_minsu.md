I am Minsu Choi, currently a postdoctoral associate at [NOAA's Global Systems Laboratory](https://gsl.noaa.gov/profiles/minsu.choi). I completed my M.S. and Ph.D. under the supervision of Dr. Ying, focusing on source-region and age-resolved modeling using CMAQ. My research interests center on air pollution in East and Southeast Asia, with particular emphasis on long-range transport of ozone and secondary inorganic species. I am also deeply engaged in studying wildfire chemistry and its impacts on regional air quality, specifically examining brown carbon light absorption. In my current role, I investigate wildfire smoke impacts on Earth's radiation budget using WRF-Chem and MPAS-A models, while also studying wildfire aerosol-meteorology interactions.
