[Dr. Jie Zhang](https://profiles.lbl.gov/432687-Jie-Zhang) holds his Ph.D. in Civil Engineering from Texas A&M University in 2021, with expertise in air quality modeling and atmospheric chemistry. Jieâ€™s professional journey has provided him a rich and diverse background in atmospheric science research, particularly in model development to investigate the physical and chemical processes underlying air pollution. Currently he works as a Scientific Engineering Associate at Division of Energy Analysis and Environmental Impacts (EAEI). His work focuses on exploring the mitigation potentials of non-CO2 greenhouse gases (GHGs) by integrating bottom-up and top-down modeling approaches to estimate emissions. Prior to LBNL, Jie worked as a Postdoc Research Associate at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), where he conducted modeling studies on aerosol and aerosol-cloud interactions. His expertise in numerical modeling techniques has enabled him to address various facets of atmospheric dynamics, including particle nucleation and growth, source apportionment, and interactions with climate and human health.
