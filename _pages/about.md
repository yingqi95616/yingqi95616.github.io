Associate Editor, [Atmospheric Environment](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/atmospheric-environment)

Associate Editor, [Frontiers of Envionmental Science and Engineering](https://link.springer.com/journal/11783)

Associate Editor, [Aerosol and Air Quality Research](https://aaqr.org/)

<span style="color:red">I will be moving to the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology from January 2025.</span>

According to the World Health Organization, 90% of the world’s population is breathing contami-nated air, and 4.2 million people worldwide die prematurely every year due to ambient air pollution. Air pollution also causes reduced crop yields by 5-12% globally, with an estimated economic loss of up to 20 billion dollars per year. My research focuses on developing and applying science-based data-driven modeling tools to elucidate the impacts of emissions from human activities on air quality so that local and state governments can make informed regulatory decisions to reduce air pollution and protect human health. My current research focuses on the following three areas:
1. mechanistic modeling of air pollution in urban and regional scales with a particular focus on source apportionment
2. multiscale modeling of criteria and toxic air pollutants for exposure assessment in epidemiology studies
3. modeling secondary organic aerosol and their chemical constituents in chemical transport models
In my spare time (don’t have much recently), I play table tennis and chess. I also like to play with single chip computers. Recently, I have been working on an Apple II+ emulator which runs on the Arduino DUE. You can see a demonstration of the emulator on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vozrPYWGqR4&t=22s) here. I also collect vintage computers. Some of my computer collections can be found here (coming soon).
