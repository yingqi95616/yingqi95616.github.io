 I was born in the beautiful Fujian Province of China, where I grew up amidst lush landscapes and a rich cultural heritage. I obtained my B.E. degree in Environmental Engineering from the China Unversity of Petroleum in Beijing. My current research focuses on understanding long-range transport of dust and the effects of future climate change on dust and wildfire emissions. These topics are critical for predicting air quality trends and developing climate adaptation strategies. When I’m not immersed in research, you’ll likely find me playing table tennis—a sport I’m passionate about for its blend of precision, strategy, and excitement.
